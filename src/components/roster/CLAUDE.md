# CLAUDE.md — Roster Builder

Directory-scoped doc for the army list builder (`/roster*`). Loaded contextually instead of
living in the monolithic `wh11ed/CLAUDE.md` — this feature's code is spread across a few
directories (below), so also read this file when touching `src/composables/roster*.js`,
`src/data/roster/`, or `src/views/tracker/Roster*.vue` even though they sit elsewhere.
`wh11ed/CLAUDE.md`'s Game Tracker section has a one-line pointer here; that's the only
mention of the roster builder in the root doc — don't duplicate this content back into it.

## What this is

Build/validate/export/share a 40k army list, then hand it off to the Game Tracker. Its own
top-level nav section (`meta: { section: 'roster' }` on every `/roster*` route in
`router/index.js`, `isRosterRoute` in `useRouteSection.js`) — a `Rosters`/«Листы армий» link
sits next to `Tracker` in the desktop navbar and the mobile drawer, and its own bottom-nav
icon sits right after `Rules`. No subnav (single-page section, like the Factions list).
Decoupled from Tracker on 2026-08-03 — it used to ride with that section (`meta.section:
'tracker'`, a `trackerGroups` entry, a card on `TrackerHomeView`); if you find a stray
`isTrackerRoute` check gating roster behavior, or a reference to a roster card on the tracker
home page, it's stale from before the split.

Routes: `/roster` (list), `/roster/new` (creation wizard), `/roster/:id` (editor),
`/roster/:id/view` (read-only), `/roster/shared` (import a shared link).

## Generated data layer

`scripts/gen-roster-data.mjs` (`npm run roster:data`), sourced from `wh40k-appdata` — same
class of derived data as the datasheet/mfm pipelines (structural facts only, no rules prose):

- `src/data/roster/core.js` — battle sizes (points / DP / enhancement+duplicate limits)
- `src/data/roster/<slug>.js` — one per faction, 30/30 generated. Units link to their
  datasheet page via `sourceIds.json`'s `ds:` entries (`linked: true` + id); unmatched units
  get a slugified id and no link. 1034/1034 units currently linked; 1 dropped for missing
  points/composition (Imperial Knights' Sir Hekhtur — check the generator's console output
  after a re-run for any new drops).
- `src/data/roster/items.js` — wargear item names + group instruction text, interned once
  across all factions (most wargear is a free swap; only ~83 options carry a points delta)
- `src/data/roster/index.js` — `loadRosterFaction(slug)`, lazy per-faction (`import.meta.glob`,
  same PWA-light-entry-chunk discipline as `data/datasheets/index.js`), folds an SM-Chapter's
  `sharedUnitIds` back in the same way `datasheets/index.js`'s `loadDatasheets` does
- Mutually-exclusive wargear groups (one group's pick depends on another group's, on the same
  datasheet+miniature) have no structural field in appdata linking them — the generator infers
  it; see the "deviation" comments in `gen-roster-data.mjs` around
  `base_miniature_loadout_wargear_option` before touching that logic.
- The generator's own top-of-file comment claiming it "emits units without gear for now" is
  **stale** — full wargear-option parsing (groups, mutual-exclusion deviation tracking, the
  interned `items.js`) is implemented. Fix that comment next time the file is touched.

## Pure logic (`src/composables/roster*.js`)

No Vue, no store — testable without mounting anything. Not colocated with this component
directory; still part of this feature:

- `rosterEngine.js` — unit grouping (`UNIT_GROUPS`: epic/characters/battleline/transports/
  other, derived from keywords), points math, leader/warlord/enhancement eligibility, wargear
  group live-state
- `rosterValidation.js` — `validateRoster()`. Philosophy: **never block**, like the official
  app — always compute a total and surface `{ code, level: 'error'|'warn', uid?, params? }`
  issues for the user to judge rather than preventing an illegal list. `code` maps to an i18n
  message rendered by `RosterIssuesModal`. Per-unit duplicate cap: the battle size's limit,
  doubled for Battleline/Dedicated Transport, hard-capped at 1 for every Epic Hero regardless
  of battle size (rule 25).
- `rosterExport.js` — plain-text army list export, official-app style, EN names throughout
  (unit/detachment/wargear names stay English by project convention)
- `rosterShare.js` — roster → deflate-compressed base64url payload carried in the URL
  **hash** (`/roster/shared#r=<payload>`, never reaches the server/CDN). Version-prefixed
  decoder (`1.` = deflate-raw, `0.` = uncompressed fallback for engines without
  `CompressionStream`, i.e. Safari < 16.4).
- `rosterHandoff.js` — pre-fills the Game Tracker's **setup draft** (`GameSetup` hydrates it
  on mount) rather than the saved-game format itself — `wh11ed-api`'s `domain/game.ts`
  contract is untouched by this feature. A partial draft is fine: `GameSetup` merges its own
  defaults over whatever fields this sets.

## Store

`src/composables/useRosters.js` — module singleton, same pattern as `useTracker.js`/
`useLocale.js`, persisted to `localStorage['wh11ed-rosters']`. Schema-versioned
(`SCHEMA_VERSION`, bump + extend `migrate()` on any shape change). Deliberately imports **no**
faction data files — the list screen must stay in the light entry chunk; only the editor
dynamic-imports the heavy per-faction `src/data/roster/<slug>.js`.

## Views (`src/views/tracker/Roster*.vue`, not in this directory)

`RosterListView`, `RosterCreateView` (4-ish-step wizard, mirrors `GameSetup`'s pattern),
`RosterEditorView` (tabbed), `RosterViewView` (read-only + a Rules tab that loads faction
rule text via `loadFaction()` from `data/factions/index.js` — **async**, not the old sync
`getFaction()`, see below), `RosterSharedView` (import landing for a `rosterShare.js` link).

## Components (this directory)

`RosterUnitBrowser` (add-unit list/search), `UnitEditorFields` (wargear/enhancement/warlord
pick UI for one unit), `WeaponProfileModal`, `EnhancementRuleModal` (loads the enhancement's
rule text via `loadFaction()`, same as `RosterViewView`), `RosterIssuesModal` (renders
`validateRoster()`'s issues), `RosterExportModal` (wraps `rosterExport.js`),
`RosterUnitRulesModal` (wraps `DatasheetCard` with its `collapsible` prop — see Known gaps),
`FactionAccentScope` (per-faction accent-color CSS custom-property scope for the editor
chrome, keyed off the roster's faction slug).

**`getFaction()` doesn't exist anymore** — `src/data/factions/index.js` was refactored
(async, code-split `loadFaction(slug)`) after this feature's early commits; `RosterViewView.vue`
and `EnhancementRuleModal.vue` were updated to `await loadFaction(slug)` when `main` was
merged in (2026-08-03). If you find another `getFaction` call site while extending this
feature, it's stale — same fix.

**`BaseModal` renders via `<Teleport to="body">`** (added on `main` after this feature's
early modal work) — any new test mounting a component that renders `BaseModal` (or a wrapper
around it, like `RosterUnitRulesModal`) must assert against `new DOMWrapper(document.body)`,
not the mounted wrapper's own `.text()`/`.find()` — the teleported content lives outside the
wrapper's DOM subtree. See `RosterUnitRulesModal.test.js` or
`src/components/tracker/modals.test.js` for the pattern.

## Known gaps

See `ROSTER-BUILDER-PROGRESS.md` at the repo root for the current open-questions list (live
modifier overlay in `RosterUnitRulesModal`, no cloud backup) — kept there rather than here
since that file is the transient tracking doc and this one is the stable reference.
